# GooeyCore Files for FXCore
The files in this directory are for the GooeyCore GUI program and rely on library files. They must be saved to an FXC and run through the FXCorePreProc pre-processor prior to being used with the FXCoreCmdAsm command line assembler from Experimental Noize or the web based assembler at https://fxcore.sandboxpedal.com/
