# Library Files for FXCore
The files in this directory are libraries of functions for the FXCore DSP. They are used in an FXC file or in GooeyCore then run through the FXCorePreProc pre-processor prior to being used with the FXCoreCmdAsm command line assembler from Experimental Noize or the web based assembler at https://fxcore.sandboxpedal.com/

To be used in GooeyCore the routine in the library file must have pins and parameters defined.
